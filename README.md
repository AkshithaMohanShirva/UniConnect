Project Idea:
UniConnect is a mobile application designed to support international students 
transitioning to life in the United States. It serves as a centralized platform providing 
essential resources and information tailored to students' needs, facilitating a smoother 
adjustment to their new environment.
Problem Statement:
International students in the United States often face significant challenges when 
transitioning to a new country, including adapting to a different academic system, 
navigating unfamiliar surroundings, and finding essential resources like banking, 
healthcare, and student-specific events. The overwhelming nature of adjusting to a new 
environment can lead to stress, isolation, and missed opportunities, particularly due to 
the lack of a single, reliable platform that provides comprehensive, up-to-date 
information tailored to student needs.
Solution:
UniConnect, a user-friendly mobile application, aims to streamline the transition for 
international students, by offering a centralized hub of essential resources and 
information. The app will feature categorized sections covering key areas such as:
• 
Banking: Guidance on the process of opening accounts and choosing student-
friendly banks. 
• Accommodation: A list of nearby housing options, including on-campus and oE-
campus accommodations, student housing complexes, rental properties, and 
tips for securing aEordable housing.
• 
Shopping: A directory of popular student shopping destinations, including deals 
on clothing, electronics, and essentials.
• 
Entertainment: Suggestions for local entertainment venues such as theatres, 
parks, sports facilities, and other recreational spots.
• 
Healthcare: Locations of nearby hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and healthcare 
centres, with details on student health services and insurance.
• 
Supermarkets: A directory of grocery stores and supermarkets, including those 
oEering international products and student-friendly deals.
• 
Transportation: Information on nearby public transportation options such as 
bus routes, train stations, ride-sharing services, bike rentals, and parking 
facilities, along with tips for navigating the city and campus eEiciently.
• 
Technological services: Guidance on setting up essential tech services, 
including information on purchasing SIM cards, mobile plans, Wi-Fi setup for 
home and campus, and resources for obtaining student-discounted laptops, 
software, and tech support.
• 
Interest groups: An inventory of all the homegroups that provide students an 
opportunity to explore diEerent cultures around and network with fellow peers 
over some fun activities and food.

• Community Forum: A dynamic networking forum for students to communicate 
about recent/new events around, on-going or upcoming student deals.
• Wellness Resource: Mental health services include counselling and workshops, 
while fitness options oEer gyms and classes. UREC promotes outdoor and 
indoor activities and wellness coaching to enhance student well-being.
The recommendations for each of the categories above will be provided based on the 
current location of the student. The data incorporated in the above sections will consist 
of information gathered from current students and their experiences, as well as from 
the online informational websites available.
These features will ensure that the students have access to accurate and current data.
This holistic approach ensures that UniConnect not only provides relevant information 
but also fosters a sense of community and belonging among students.
